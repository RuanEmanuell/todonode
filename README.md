A simple todo list made with NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB as the database. Made for porposes of training back-end development. 
    
### How to Run

You need to download the files from this directory, start a <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/pt-br">MongoDB</a> server, then run the following commands in your IDE of choice:

     These commands install the required packages:
     
     npm i body-parser
     npm i express
     npm i mongoose
     npm i -D nodemon
     
     
     Now to run the project, you will use:
     npm run dev (you can change that in package.json)

You also need to go to the 'src/utils/database.js' file and put your mongoDB key in there in order to use the database connector.
